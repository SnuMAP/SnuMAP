SnuMAP Installation Guide

================================================================================
< Prerequisites >

1. Super-user access (sudo) required

2. Set the environment variables
   $ source env.sh

3. numactl installed (# apt-get install numactl)

4. python (including matplotlib) installed

< Testbed >
The framework is evaluated on Debian Linux (Ubuntu).
The experimental environment, a 32-core AMD Opteron server, is provided to the
testers. The required programs are already installed on the machine.

================================================================================
< Installation of the SnuMAP-patched Linux kernel >
To enable SnuMAP in your linux kernel, you have to patch our kernel implementation.
You can find our patch in src/kernel-patches/

We provide two patches for linux-3.19, and tilera-ported linux-3.14 kernel.
If you use different version of Linux, then we recommmend you to patch our
implementation in your Linux kernel.
We add just tens of lines of codes.
We tested the Linux kernel patch on Linux 3.X and 2.X.

We think the kernel porting will not harm your Linux if you use Linux kernel 
version 3.X or 2.X.

================================================================================
< Installation of the SnuMAP >
The installation script creates all SnuMAP binaries, kernel module,
and library files.

1. You have to set environment variables before every SnuMAP use.
   $ source env.sh

2. We provide an installation script that installs all SnuMAP software modules
   $ ./install.sh

< Uninstall SnuMAP >
The uninstallation script removes all SnuMAP binaries, kernel module,
and library files

1. $ source env.sh
2. $ ./uninstall.sh

================================================================================
< Installation of the applications - use cases >

We provide some test applications.
For example, if you want to test NPB-OpenMP applications with SnuMAP,
1. $ cd $SNUMAP_ROOT/examples/NPB3.3-OMP-C/
2. $ make suite
This command creates all applications in the benchmark suite.
This benchmark set is not ours, it is from http://aces.snu.ac.kr
